The user first lands on this nostalgiac login page which allows them to make a new Kittygotchi, or enter their name to access their previously created pet.  If on account creation the username already exists, an alert will pop-up to tell them to choose a new username.

As the kitty's hearts begin to dwindle, the user will ideally click the 'Feed' button which will bring down a fish for the pet to eat.  On consumption, the kitty will make clear chomping sounds and one heart will fill.  If the kitty is continuously fed, it will eventually grow to be older and weigh more.

(If the kitty's hearts lower to zero, it will meow to tell the user to feed it some fish)

On click of the 'Sleep' button, the cat will stop bouncing and begin to dream of mice.  The 'lights' will also go off until the 'Sleep' button is clicked again.
